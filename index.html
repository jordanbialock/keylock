<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Some excerpts from Jordan's diary </h2>
<p> January 12th 2014 at 2:08am "Hello diary. I can't believe I have been facebook messaging Keaton since about 9:30pm! I'm starting to love our late night convos :) I wish we saw each other more at school." </p>
<p> April 5th 2014 "Keaton and I biked together by his house yesterday. It was wonderful. Lately on our facebook chats we've been sharing music, taking turns playing DJ. On our bike ride he disclosed that he's insecure and indecisive. We'll work on that together. Hopefully we'll hang out again soon...hopefull a date?!" </p>
<p> June 15th 2014 "At the fair I rode with Keaton most of the time, playing footsie while seated ;) We linked arms too! On the log ride he gave me hugs from behind and when we walked he would grab my shoulders and sway. When we were on the sky ride together a group of teens asked if we were a couple! And they said we were really cute! At the end of the night we took the bus to the parking lot. He stayed with me while I waited for my dad; I rested my head on his shoulder. I don't know if we are a couple yet, but when he gets back from camp we will "dicuss us." I really think we like each other though! :D" </p>
